Prepare your dataset
    Your folder structure should be:
    my_dataset/
    ├── real/
    │   ├── img1.jpg
    │   ├── img2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    ├── hybrid/
    │   ├── img1.jpg
    │   ├── img2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── masks/
        ├── img1.png
        ├── img2.png
        └── ..."""
no masks also no problem


In the prepare data.py
- if want first run this file it is check whether the the folder structure are good to check that run this
- the prepare data will also run on the train script also but usually run it first
- change input path in prepare data code 

To train simple version first run - run run_simple.py
- change the dataset path and save dir in train_simple.py in train_folders function

train_simple.py
- it is used for higher epochs after simple run it
- while running this always look for and change the save_dir in config
